# Recursion

This isn't a requirement, but I personally believe recursion is a lot easier to understand if you already understand *iteration*. 
Although... ![ive-head-it-both-ways-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71098431/216202375-da92b61c-41be-420a-af6f-036f9417c0f7.gif)

The following explanations will assume basic knowledge of functions, however, so please review that now if you need to! 

## Analogies

There's a lot of fun analogies for recursion. One way to think of it is like when you point a mirror at another mirror and it creates that endless tunnel effect? One of my favorite ways to explain it when introducing it as a new topic is by saying "for now, just think of it like magic," 
which I think makes sense, because that's the same way you used to think about the mirror thing before you learned [how it worked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_mirror).

## Straight up

The straight up defintion of recursion as relevant to computer science is as follows: 
                                         
__*a recursive function is a function that calls itself*__

## Back to analogies
                                     
Let's think about a basic function as a part of an assembly line in a factory. It's something that knows how to carry out a single task.
